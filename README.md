# Heated-Bed-Modeling
Finite Difference thermal modeling of a FFF heated bed. 

This project is described at http://jcmccaw.com/2019/07/27/thermal-modelling-of-a-fdm-printer-heated-bed/ . You can find out more or contact me about the project at the preceeding link. 

Here, the MATLAB simulation script, presentations showing the maths we went through to create the script, and all of our collected data are found in the appropriately labeled directories.
